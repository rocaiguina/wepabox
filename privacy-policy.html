 <h3><b>Privacy Policy<br>
</b></h3>
<p>We respect the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes our privacy practices with respect to the information collected through the <b>WEPA!BOX</b> website located at www.wepabox.com (hereinafter “Website”) and operated by <b>PR Island Export LLC </b>(hereinafter “<b>WEPA!BOX</b>” and/or “we” and/or “our”). This Policy is intended to explain the conditions under which <b>WEPA!BOX</b> collects, uses and discloses your personal and other information in relation to the Website, and your rights in relation to that information. By visiting our Website and/or using the functions and/or services available through the Website, you accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The personal and other information we collect about you is controlled by <b>PR Island Export LLC</b>, which is headquartered in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with address at Caparra Heights 365 Avenida Escorial, San Juan P.R. 00920-3508.</p>
<p><b><br>
WHAT PERSONAL AND OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU:</b></p>
<p><b>WEPA!BOX</b> collects both “Personal Information” and “Non-Personal information” about Website users. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Non-Personal information” is information that <b>WEPA!BOX</b> cannot directly associate with a specific person without the aid of additional information. By contrast, “Personal Information” is defined as any name or number that can be used by itself or together with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including, but not limited to, name, surname, telephone number, email, gender, postal code and date and/or place of birth.</p>
<p><b>Personal information: </b>In order to subscribe to our services or use many of the features of our Website, you will be required to provide Personal information.</p>
<p><b>Orders and Registry:</b> To use some features of the Website, including subscribing to any of our services, either to our annual or monthly subscriptions, you must first register. During the Registration process, you must provide certain Personal Information: Name, mailing address, billing address, date of birth, email and phone number. For its part, the external payment processor will require you to provide another type of Personal Information. All personal information collected through the external payment processor of your choice (Pay Pal or Stripe) will be collected and handled in accordance with the privacy policies established by the external payment processor. <b>WEPA!BOX</b> is not responsible for the handling of your Personal Information by the external payment processor. Be sure to read and understand the privacy policies applicable to the external payment processor before providing any type of information.</p>
<p>We may combine personal information collected through the Website with other information that third parties, or we collect about you in other contexts—such as our communications with you via email or phone, or your customer service records. We will treat such combined information as personal information and protect it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b>Surveys, Contests, and Promotions: </b>From time to time, <b>WEPA!BOX</b> may request users of the Website to participate in surveys, contests or promotions. These surveys, contests or promotions may be used by <b>WEPA!BOX</b> to collect Personal and Non-Personal Information. Participation is completely voluntary and, therefore, you have the option of providing your information or not.</p>
<p><b>Registration Data and Use of the Website:</b> When you use the Website, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or other device) and your browser. This may include data such as your IP address and domain name, the date and time of your visit, the files you download, your software and hardware attributes (including device IDs), your general geographic location (for example, your city, state or metropolitan region) and certain cookie information (See information below). To obtain such information, we can use web logs or applications that recognize your computer or device and collect information about your online activity.</p>
<p><b>Cookies:</b> We also use cookies in the Website. Cookies are small files that your browser stores on your computer or other device. A cookie allows the Website to recognize if you have visited the Website before and can store the user’s preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be used to collect information about your use of the Website during your current session (including the pages you visit and the files you download), the operating system, and the browser type of your computer or other device, your Internet service provider, your domain name and IP address and your general geographical location. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer or device, you can set your browser to reject all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, which allows you to decide whether to accept them. You can also delete cookies from your computer or device. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Website may not work properly.</p>
<p><b>Web Beacons: </b>We can also use an application known as “web beacon”. A web beacon is an electronic file that generally consists of a single pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include Personal Information. For example, it allows an email sender to determine if a user has opened a particular email.</p>
<p><b>Third-party tracking and behavioral-based advertising: </b>We may also associate with certain third parties to collect, analyze and use part of the Personal and Non-Personal Information described in this section. For example, we may allow third parties to establish cookies or use web beacons on the Website or in electronic mail communications from <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. This information may be used for a variety of purposes, including advertising based on online behavior, as explained below (see the section titled “How we share personal and non-personal information with third parties”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT: WEPA!BOX</b> uses the information we collect from you for a variety of purposes. If we have Personal Information about you, we may use it, for example: to answer your questions or requests related to the Website and/or other services; to comply with the terms of any agreement you have with us; to fulfill your requests for our services and product orders or to complete a transaction you initiate; to send you information about our services, the status (“status”) of any order and other topics that are likely to interest you, including newsletters, updates or other communications; to authenticate billing and identification information; to deliver confirmations, account information, notifications, allocations, announcements related to the service and similar operational communications; to improve or personalize your user experience; to improve the quality of our products and services; to comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements; and to manage our business.</p>
<p>We use the Non-Personal Information that we collect for purposes such as: counting and recognizing the users of the Website; analyzing the demographics, interests and behavior of users, including the way they use the Website and various features of the Website; improve the Website and improve the experiences of the users of the Website; investigate and create new products and services or improve our existing products and services; Allow analysis and additional investigation of the Website; and administer our business. <b>WEPA!BOX</b> may link the Non-Personal Information collected through cookies and web beacons with Personal Information. But in that case, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may also use the Personal and Non-Personal Information we collect to send you promotional communications, including emails or regular mail, about the products and services offered by <b>WEPA!BOX</b> or our partners. Although we expect our emails to be of your interest, you may choose not to receive them during the Registration process to any of our Services. Promotional emails will also have instructions to reject that type of communication in the future.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our service to send our Products to a third party, we will request the third party’s mailing address. This personal information may be used only to process the shipment of the order made by you to that third party. By using our services and/or submitting information from a third party, you expressly state that you have authorization from that third party to submit their Personal Information. However, the third party can contact us through info@wepabox.com to request that we eliminate this information from our database. Please take into consideration that if the third party requests that this information be deleted prior to sending an Order, it will be impossible for us to process your shipment request. The Personal Information of a third party will be treated the same as your Personal Information. The third party must include the subject of their request as part of the subject of the email they send us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES: </b></p>
<p>We share your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with third parties for a variety of purposes, as described below.</p>
<p><b>Analytical Purposes and Behavioral Advertising:</b> We partner with certain third parties to collect Non-Personal Information as defined above in this Privacy Policy and to participate in the analysis, audit, investigation and reporting. These third parties can use web registries or web beacons, and can configure and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, third parties may use online tracking systems such as Google Analytics (hereinafter “Tracking Mechanisms”) to help them collect and analyze certain information for the purposes mentioned above.</p>
<p>The Website also allows third parties to collect your Non-Personal Information for use in online behavioral advertising. For example, a third party may use the fact that you visited the Website to target <b>WEPA!BOX</b> ads on websites not related to <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. In addition, third parties may use information about your use of the Website to help guide advertising not related to <b>WEPA!BOX</b>, based on your online behavior.</p>
<p>The use of Online Tracking Mechanisms by third parties is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties, and not to this Privacy Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from configuring and accessing cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to block cookies. Although our platforms do not currently respond to “do not track” signals.</p>
<p><b>Third party service providers and business partners:</b> The Website also uses other third party service providers to help us administer and improve the Website and other <b>WEPA!BOX</b> services. These service providers may collect and/or use your Personal or Non-Personal Information to help us achieve the purposes mentioned above in the section entitled “How We Use the Personal and Non-Personal Information We Collect”. For example, we use third parties to help guide and implement our communications by email and direct mail, to verify your identity and address for shipping purposes, to send our products and to process the subscription payment. We also use third party platforms to help us manage our relationships with the people and companies that use our services.</p>
<p>We may also share your Personal or Non-Personal Information with other third parties when necessary to satisfy your requests for services; to complete a transaction that you initiate; comply with the terms of any agreement you have with our partners; or us, or to manage our business.</p>
<p><b>Direct exchange of Personal Information through websites and third-party services:</b> The Website may allow you to directly share Personal Information with websites or online services operated by third parties, for example, the external payment processing company. Because these websites and third party services are not operated by <b>WEPA!BOX</b>, we are not responsible for the content or practices of such websites or services. The collection, use and disclosure of your Personal and Non-Personal Information in any third party website will be subject to the privacy policies of the websites or third-party services, and not to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b>Legal purposes:</b> We may also use or share your Personal or Non-Personal Information with third parties when we understand, in our sole discretion, that it is necessary to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>to comply with applicable law or a court order, subpoena or other legal process;</li>
<li>to investigate, prevent or take action with respect to illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of our Terms and Conditions of Use, or situations involving a threat to our property or the property or physical safety of any person or third party;</li>
<li>to establish, protect or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or</li>
<li>to facilitate the financing, insurance, sale, assignment, bankruptcy or other real provision or proposal of all or part of our business or assets.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Aggregated Information:</b> From time to time, <b>WEPA!BOX</b> may also share aggregate information about users of the Website, such as publishing a report on trends in the use of the Website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SECURITY:</b></p>
<p><b>WEPA!BOX</b> uses commercially reasonable physical and electronic safeguards and procedures to protect your Personal Information from loss or unauthorized access, use, modification or deletion. When you enter Personal and/or Confidential Information in our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information through SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Rapid SSL security certificates. However, no security program is infallible and, therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal or other Information.</p>
<p><b>REVIEW AND UPDATE OF YOUR INFORMATION:</b></p>
<p>If you wish to obtain more information about the Personal Information that <b>WEPA!BOX</b> has about you, or if you wish to update or change that information, or deactivate your account, contact us through the email: info@wepabox.com. Please include the subject for which you are contacting us, as part of the subject field of any email you send us. This allows us to send communications directly to the staff that can help you and expedite the process to answer any questions or process any request. Include all the information pertinent to your inquiry and/or request as part of your email.</p>
<p>Please note that disabling your <b>WEPA!BOX</b> account will not remove your Personal and Non-Personal Information from our servers. You can request such removal by sending an email to info@wepabox.com and placing in the subject of the email the reason for your communication as provided in this section.</p>
<p><b>CHILDRENS PRIVACY:</b></p>
<p>This Website is not intended for children under 21 years of age. We will not intentionally collect information from visitors who are under 21 years of age. We encourage parents to talk with their children about the use of the Internet and the information they provide in the different portals or websites.</p>

<p><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY:</b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will publish all changes to this Privacy Policy on this Website, so you should review the policy periodically. In addition, we will send a notice of any amendment to the Privacy Policy to the email address provided by you during your registration.
