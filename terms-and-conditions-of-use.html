If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any payment method problems before we proceed with your Order. If you wish to change or update your payment method information, you may do so at any time by accessing your selected external payment processor account (you can choose between Pay Pal or Stripe). On the other hand, if you wish to change or update your billing address information or shipping information, manage your Subscription, examine your order history, active subscriptions, and other notes, you may do so by logging into your <b>WEPA!BOX </b>Account. Any change in credit card numbers must be made through the external payment processor selected by you to make any payment in <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. If a payment is not successfully settled and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your Subscription (cancellation option is only applicable to Monthly subscriptions), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the corresponding amount.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, preferences you select, changes you make to your Subscription or changes in applicable taxes, rates and shipping costs, or other charges, and you authorize us (or our third party-payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.</p>
<p><b>5.6 Pricing and Availability</b></p>
<p>All prices are shown in U.S. dollars and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, are additional. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice; provided, however, that if we change the amounts or other charges associated with our various subscription plans, we will provide advance notice of such changes through an email sent to the email address provided by you when creating an Account in <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. We will not, however, be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes or any modifications on shipping costs or rates as disposed by the United States Postal Service. The shipment of any Products to you after our delivery of such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes, unless you cancel your subscription(s) in accordance with the Cancellation Policy set forth in Sections 5.4 of this Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
<p>Prices detailed in sections 5.2 and 5.3 of these Terms and Conditions of Use do not include charges for taxes, duties, shipping and handling, or other charges applicable to the shipping/delivery of a <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. Please note that there is a possibility that fees/taxes may apply to your Order depending on the selected country of destination for your <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. These charges would be applicable to each shipment of a <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. Also, bear in mind that the final price to be paid by you may vary depending on the shipping and handling costs charged by our shipping service provider, United States Postal Service (“USPS”). Once you indicate the address to which you wish to send a <b>WEPA!BOX</b>, the Website will calculate the shipping and handling costs prior to processing any payment.</p>
<p>Also, laws or regulations applicable in certain countries require the collection of certain fees and/or taxes at the time of delivery of a package or article. <b>WEPA!BOX</b> is not responsible for paying these fees/taxes. Your refusal to pay these fees/taxes may result in the package being returned to <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. If this is the case, our ability to resend or reimburse an Order would only be viable if the <b>WEPA!BOX</b> is returned to our facilities.</p>
<p>In turn, keep in mind that buying or making an Order with a different currency can generate conversion rates and higher/lower amounts depending on the value of your currency compared to the US dollar.</p>
<p><b>5.7. Return Policy</b></p>
<p><b>WEPA!BOX</b> does not accept returns of boxes or any individual Product contained therein. All sales are final. All boxes and products are checked before being packed and shipped, and although <b>WEPA!BOX</b> strives to ensure that the box and the Products contained in it are in good condition, they can be damaged during the shipping process. If you understand that you have received a damaged or defective product as part of your <b>WEPA!BOX</b>, you must send an email to info@wepabox.com, with your request, including in it photographs of the product that you believe is damaged or defective. This request must be made within a period no longer than 3 days after the date on which you receive the box. If this period elapses, no return request will be processed. It will be the decision of <b>WEPA!BOX</b> to decide whether or not to replace the product with a new one based on your request and the received photographs. It will be the responsibility of the subscriber to pay the shipping and handling costs of sending a defective or damaged Product to the <b>WEPA!BOX</b> address. No product should be returned until <b>WEPA!BOX</b> has confirmed that a return process has been approved. No used Products will be replaced. In the event that <b>WEPA!BOX</b> decides to make a replacement for understanding that the product is indeed damaged or defective, it will send you a new product within an approximate period of 5 to 8 business days from the receipt of the defective or damaged product in the <b>WEPA!BOX</b> address. All shipping and handling costs for sending the new product to a Domestic location will be covered by <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. All shipping and handling costs for sending the new product to an International location shall be covered by you. All shipping will be made to the address provided by you when an Order was made. &nbsp;If the same product is not available <b>WEPA!BOX</b> will send you a similar product of equal or greater value to the one returned by you. At no time will a new box be sent.</p>
<p><b>5.8</b> <b>Taxes</b></p>
<p>You may be charged with sales taxes when applicable.<br>
<b>&nbsp;5.9</b> <b>Deliveries</b></p>
<p>If you are not at home when your Order arrives, the courier will generally leave the package for you at your door. Any individual at the delivery address who accepts a delivery from us is presumed to be authorized to receive such delivery. In cases in which you have designated an alternative receiver, such person shall accept the delivery under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself.</p>
<p>In the case of inclement weather or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your Order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur prior to the scheduled delivery date. If timely delivery of your Order is not feasible, you will be notified of such delay to the email address provided in your <b>WEPA!BOX</b> Account, along with a new delivery date (“Notification of Delay”). However, you will have the option to cancel your Order for the period affected and that a credit is issued to your next Order or to receive a full refund of the cost corresponding to the box that could not be delivered in a timely manner. If a refund is requested for a delayed box on an Annual Subscription, you will be reimbursed with the cost corresponding to a single box in the Annual Subscription, that is $29.99. Credits are only available if you maintain an active Subscription in <b>WEPA!BOX</b>. This means that if you cancel your Subscription to <b>WEPA!BOX</b>, any outstanding credit associated with your canceled subscription will expire immediately. All decisions related to your credit balance will be determined in our sole discretion and are final. Any refund will be made through the same payment method used to make an Order. If you do not respond to our Notice of Delay and the delay is 30 days or less, it will be understood that you accept the delay and are willing to wait for the Products. However, if you do not respond, and the delay is more than 30 days, we will cancel the delayed Order and you will receive a refund after you request it. To request your refund you must write us an email to info@wepabox.com along with your request. <b>If we do not receive your refund request, we will not be able to process any refund.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.10 No Resale</b></p>
<p>You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the Products for commercial purposes.</p>
